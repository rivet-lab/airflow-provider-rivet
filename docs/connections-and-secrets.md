# Connections and secrets

What reaches the rivet process, and how Airflow Connections become what rivet reads.

## Secrets

- rivet is configured through environment variables and nothing else, and **the subprocess gets
  a minimal environment, not the worker's**. It is built from three things:
  1. The worker's variables on one allow-list (`ENV_ALLOWLIST` in `invocation.py`): `PATH`,
     `HOME`, `USER`, `LOGNAME`, `TZ`, `LANG`, `LC_*`, `TMPDIR`, `SSL_CERT_FILE`, `SSL_CERT_DIR`,
     `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`, `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`,
     `no_proxy`, `all_proxy`, `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST`, `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT`. Nothing else
     is inherited: not `AIRFLOW__*`, not `AIRFLOW_CONN_*`, not a `RIVET_*` variable set on the
     worker. `env_passthrough=["RIVET_STATE_URL", "MY_*"]` extends the list with names or
     shell-style patterns. `cloud_credentials=["gcp", "aws", "azure"]` adds
     `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `AWS_*`, `AZURE_*` for a
     destination or warehouse that authenticates from the environment. A storage Connection
     (`connections=`, below) that supplies a credential of one of these kinds **replaces** the
     worker's variables of that kind, whichever way they were passed: the worker's
     `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` never rides beside a Connection's static keys, nor its account key beside
     a Connection's SAS token. A Connection that supplies no credential (an AWS one with only a
     region, a GCP one with only a project) leaves the worker's identity in place.
  2. `env={NAME: value}`. It is not templated and not stored in the metadata database, but it
     is whatever your DAG file computes: do not write a secret literal there.
  3. `env_from_connections={ENV_NAME: conn_id}`, which builds a URL from an Airflow Connection's
     fields inside `execute`, credentials percent-encoded, and so the database name for PostgreSQL, MySQL and
     MongoDB. For SQL Server and Oracle the database is written as it is, because rivet reads that URL path without
     decoding it; a name holding `@`, `?` or `#` (and `/` on Oracle) is refused
     (`RIVET_AIRFLOW_CONNECTION_UNSUPPORTED`) as rivet would cut it there. An IPv6 host of a SQL Server connection with no
     port gets `:1433`, which rivet needs to split host from port. The scheme
     comes from `{ENV_NAME: (conn_id, "postgresql")}`, else the connection extra `rivet_scheme`,
     else the connection type (`postgres`, `mysql`, `mssql`, `mongo`, `oracle`); a type that
     names no rivet scheme, such as `generic`, is refused before rivet starts
     (`RIVET_AIRFLOW_CONNECTION_SCHEME`). A password without a login is kept, an IPv6 literal is
     bracketed with its zone encoded (`fe80::1%eth0` becomes `[fe80::1%25eth0]`), any other host
     is kept as written (`db:5432` with an empty port field), an Oracle connection's extra
     `service_name` is used as the path. The standard extras that have a URL form become query
     parameters: PostgreSQL `sslmode`, `application_name`, `connect_timeout`; MongoDB `srv` (the
     `mongodb+srv` scheme, which takes no port), `authSource`, `authMechanism`, `replicaSet`,
     `tls`/`ssl`, `allow_insecure`, `directConnection`, `readPreference`, `appName`. An extra
     that changes how the hook authenticates and has no URL form (PostgreSQL `iam`, `redshift`;
     MySQL `unix_socket`) is refused (`RIVET_AIRFLOW_CONNECTION_UNSUPPORTED`). Other extras are
     client-library settings and are not read. The extra `rivet_params` is appended as written
     and wins over a mapped extra of the same name. A `conn_id` no backend
     defines, here or in `connections=[...]`, is refused before rivet starts
     (`RIVET_AIRFLOW_CONNECTION_MISSING`), not retried.
  4. `connections=[conn_id, ...]`: storage and warehouse Connections, see below.

  argv carries the config path, export names and flags.
- XCom carries code, class, exit_code, retryable, action, kind, counts, `stop_reason`, the
  degradations and file paths. It never carries the error `message`: redaction covers
  credentials only, and error text can embed source cell values.
- The task log gets a readable block (see ["Reading the task log"](operators.md#reading-the-task-log)):
  outcome, codes, class, action, counts, run id, step exit statuses, paths, and, on a failure, rivet's
  error text on the headline and on a failed unit's line, and in the exception. That text is rivet's,
  not the package's: Airflow's secrets masker reads it first, it is cut to one line of at most 300
  characters, and its control characters are shown as escapes. It can still hold a source value (a
  cell that failed to convert), which is why it is in the task log and the exception and never in XCom.
  Names the DAG gives (export, table) are the only other text in it the package did not write. The one-line JSON records,
  `rivet.start` (argv), `rivet.step`, `rivet.unit` (one per unit), `rivet.result`, `rivet.warning`,
  `rivet.crashed`, `rivet.cdc.max_events`, `rivet.refused`, ..., are written at DEBUG, under the
  same rules.
- **rivet's raw stdout and stderr go to files and never to the task log or to the worker
  process's own stderr** (which Airflow 3, and Airflow 2 with `run_as_user`, copy into the task
  log). The files are
  `<base>/<dag_id>/<task_id>-<hash>/<run_id>__try<N>.<step>.stderr.log` (and `.stdout.log`), mode `0600`
  in `0700` directories; XCom and a failed task's `stderr` log line name the path (and the
`rivet.start` record at DEBUG). `<base>` is
  `stderr_dir` when given, else `<state_dir>/logs`, else, on a worker with no state directory,
  `<temp dir>/rivet-airflow-<uid>/logs` (recorded as `stderr_temp`; a pod loses the files with
  its disk, and what a failure was is still in the error object).
- **Retention.** When a task ends, the files of its newest `log_keep` tries (default 10, counted
  per task across runs) are kept and the older ones are removed. `log_keep=None` keeps
  everything. Only the task's own folder is looked at; a file of an older layout is never
  removed (see "Upgrading a state directory" in [State](state.md#local-worker-setup-guide)). Under `airflow/<dag_id>/`, a sealed plan artifact
  that has expired and was last written over 24 h ago is removed (with the `plans/<run_id>/`
  folder it leaves empty, when the folder itself was untouched for 24 h before the pass: the folder of a run in
  progress, even an empty one, is never removed by a sibling task's cleanup), and so is a crashed ledger untouched for 24 h (a crash of that series
  more than 24 h after its last one starts a fresh budget). A ledger that is not the ledger's JSON
  is left for a person to delete.
- `stream_stderr=True` copies stderr into the task log when each step ends. It is the one way
  raw stderr reaches the task log, and it is for debugging: it puts possibly data-bearing text
  into a store with wider access than the worker.

## Storage and warehouse connections

`connections=["gcp_rivet", "sf_rivet"]` (on every operator, or in a builder's `operator_kwargs`)
turns each Airflow Connection into what rivet reads, inside `execute`: variables, and key files
written mode `0600` into a private folder that is removed when the task ends, whatever its
outcome. The kind comes from the connection type, or from the extra `rivet_kind`; one task
takes at most one Connection of each kind (`RIVET_AIRFLOW_CONNECTION_KIND_TWICE`), and a type
that is none of them is refused before rivet starts (`RIVET_AIRFLOW_CONNECTION_KIND`).

| Kind (connection type) | Read from the Connection | rivet gets | The config names it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gcp` (`google_cloud_platform`) | extra `keyfile_dict` (written to a file) or `key_path`; `project` | `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` | nothing: GCS and BigQuery read it |
| `aws` (`aws`) | login, password; extras `aws_session_token`, `region_name`, `endpoint_url`. A role (`role_arn`, `assume_role_*`), a `profile_name`, or keys in extras (also under `session_kwargs`) are refused, `RIVET_AIRFLOW_CONNECTION_UNSUPPORTED`: rivet signs with static or session keys only | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` | `access_key_env: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `secret_key_env: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (+ `session_token_env`) |
| `azure` (`wasb`) | login (account), password (key); extra `sas_token` | `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT`, `AZURE_STORAGE_KEY`, `AZURE_STORAGE_SAS_TOKEN` | `account_name: ${AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT}` (rivet reads no account variable of its own), and `account_key_env: AZURE_STORAGE_KEY` or `sas_token_env: AZURE_STORAGE_SAS_TOKEN` |
| `snowflake` (`snowflake`) | extras `account`, `region`, `role`, `warehouse`, `database`, `private_key_content` (PEM, or base64 of PEM as Airflow's SnowflakeHook takes it; written to a file) or `private_key_file`; with a key the password is the key's passphrase, else the login password | a `snow` connection named as `load.connection` in a private `SNOWFLAKE_HOME`; `RIVET_SNOWFLAKE_KEY`; `PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE` for an encrypted key | `load.connection` |
| `clickhouse` (`clickhouse`, or any type with `rivet_kind: clickhouse`) | host (required, `RIVET_AIRFLOW_CONNECTION_INCOMPLETE` without one), port, login, password; extra `secure` or `protocol` | `RIVET_CLICKHOUSE_URL`, `RIVET_CLICKHOUSE_USER`, `RIVET_CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD`, and the password also under the config's own `password_env` (`rivet init` writes `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD`) | `url: ${RIVET_CLICKHOUSE_URL}`, `user: ${RIVET_CLICKHOUSE_USER}`, `password_env: RIVET_CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` (or any name) |

The config keeps what is not a secret (bucket, project, dataset, database, schema); the
Connection holds who may write there. The Snowflake loader runs the `snow` CLI, which must be on
the worker (`pip install snowflake-cli` into its own environment). On BigQuery `rivet compact`
merges the buffer into the base table; on Snowflake and ClickHouse the current state is a view
over `<table>__changes` and there is nothing to merge. rivet 0.32.2 reports that table as `skipped` in its result
(`compact [<table>]: skipped — this warehouse keeps a change log behind a view and never compacts`),
so a compact task whose every table is skipped ends as an Airflow skip, not green. For these warehouses
build the CDC DAG with `compact=False` and leave such exports out of `compact_exports`.

## Source credentials from Google Secret Manager

A config can name its source's URL or password by a Secret Manager secret instead of a Connection, an environment
variable or a file. rivet reads the secret when it starts; the value is never written to the plan, the state or the log.

```yaml
source:
  type: postgres
  url_secret: projects/my-project/secrets/shop-url          # the whole URL, latest version
```

```yaml
source:
  type: mysql
  host: db.internal
  user: rivet
  database: shop
  password_secret: projects/my-project/secrets/shop-mysql-pw/versions/3   # a pinned version
```

- `url_secret` takes the place of `url`, `url_env` or `url_file`: exactly one of them. `password_secret` takes the
  place of `password` or `password_env`: at most one. A reference is `projects/<project>/secrets/<secret>` (the
  latest version) or `.../versions/<n>`; any other shape is `RIVET_CONFIG_SOURCE_CONNECTION_INVALID`.
- The credential is the one the GCS and BigQuery legs use: the key `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` names, or gcloud
  application-default credentials. It needs `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` on each secret, not on the project.
  A secret rivet cannot read stops the run with `RIVET_CONFIG_GCP_SECRET_UNREADABLE`, naming the secret: HTTP 403 is the
  missing role, 404 a wrong project, name or version. That is an environment failure, so it is not retried as a bad config.
- The worker passes the key to rivet the way it passes it to those legs. Either a GCP Connection with a key
  (`connections=["gcp_rivet"]`, which writes `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` for the task) or
  `cloud_credentials=["gcp"]` (the worker's own `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` passed through). A worker whose
  identity Google's default chain finds without a file (a GKE workload identity, a VM's service account) needs neither.
- A config with `url_secret` reads no source Connection: a DAG built from it (below) needs only the state Connection.
- **rivet version.** Secret sources need rivet 0.33.0 or newer <!-- TODO: the version rivet-lab/rivet#717 ships in -->.
  An older rivet is refused before it starts with `RIVET_AIRFLOW_BINARY_TOO_OLD`, naming the version needed.

`rivet init` writes `url_env:`. To source a config from a secret, write the file yourself, or change the written
`url_env: <NAME>` line to `url_secret: ...` before the DAG parses it. Then the DAG for the source reads the secret:

```python
from datetime import datetime

from airflow_provider_rivet.dags import build_source_dags

# shop.yaml in config_dir names the secret (url_secret) and the exports; the DAG reads that file at parse time.
globals().update(
    build_source_dags(
        ["shop"],
        mode="batch",
        config_dir="/opt/airflow/dags/rivet",
        state_root="/opt/airflow/rivet-state",
        state_connection="rivet_state",
        # the worker's GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS for the secret, as the GCS and BigQuery legs get it
        operator_kwargs={"cloud_credentials": ["gcp"]},
        schedule="0 */2 * * *",
        start_date=datetime(2026, 1, 1),
        catchup=False,
    )
)
```

## Connections and secrets: recommended setup

Where the Connections of a rivet DAG live decides who else can read them. Safest first:

1. **Keyless GCP: the worker's own identity.** On GKE the worker pod runs as a Kubernetes service
   account bound to a Google service account (Workload Identity); on Cloud Composer it is the
   environment's service account. No key file exists anywhere. The GCP Connection holds only
   `project`; a Connection that supplies no credential leaves the worker's identity in place, and
   rivet finds it through Google's default chain (GCS: an ADC file, else the metadata server).
   rivet's BigQuery loader has no metadata-server path of its own: with no ADC
   file it runs `gcloud auth application-default print-access-token`, so a Workload Identity
   worker that loads BigQuery needs the `gcloud` CLI on its `PATH`. The live gate proves this
   leg with a credential file mounted read-only where the default chain looks; it has no
   Workload Identity to test.
2. **Google Secret Manager as Airflow's secrets backend** for what has to be a secret: the
   Snowflake key, the ClickHouse password, source database passwords. Airflow reads a Connection
   from Secret Manager when a task asks for it; it is never in the metadata database, a compose
   file or the container's environment. The worker's identity is granted access to the
   connection secrets only, not to the project's other secrets.
3. **Connections in the metadata database, with a Fernet key set** (`[core] fernet_key`).
   Without one Airflow stores every password in clear and logs `empty cryptography key`.
4. **`AIRFLOW_CONN_*` environment variables: the worst place.** They are readable through
   `docker inspect`, `/proc/<pid>/environ` of every Airflow process, compose files and
   deployment manifests. Use them for a throwaway stand only (the live gate's default leg).

**GCP, keyless.** The Connection (it holds no secret, so it may live anywhere):

```bash
airflow connections add gcp_rivet --conn-json '{"conn_type": "google_cloud_platform", "extra": {"project": "my-project"}}'
```

The grants, for a worker running as `rivet-worker@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com` (these are the
usual roles; the gate runs as a project owner and does not measure the minimum):

```bash
GSA=rivet-worker@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding "$GSA" --role roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \
  --member "serviceAccount:my-project.svc.id.goog[airflow/airflow-worker]"     # GKE: namespace/KSA
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs://my-bucket --member "serviceAccount:$GSA" --role roles/storage.objectAdmin
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding my-project --member "serviceAccount:$GSA" --role roles/bigquery.jobUser
bq add-iam-policy-binding --member "serviceAccount:$GSA" --role roles/bigquery.dataEditor my-project:raw
```

**Secrets, from Google Secret Manager.** Airflow's configuration (`airflow.cfg`, or the same as
`AIRFLOW__SECRETS__BACKEND` / `AIRFLOW__SECRETS__BACKEND_KWARGS`, which hold no secret):

```ini
[secrets]
backend = airflow.providers.google.cloud.secrets.secret_manager.CloudSecretManagerBackend
backend_kwargs = {"connections_prefix": "airflow-connections", "sep": "-", "variables_prefix": null, "config_prefix": null, "project_id": "my-project"}
```

A conn_id `sf_rivet` is then the secret `airflow-connections-sf_rivet`, holding the Connection in
Airflow's JSON form. Make each secret from a file or stdin, never from a command-line argument:

```bash
# Snowflake: the key file goes in whole (private_key_content), the login is the key's user
jq -n --rawfile key rsa_key.p8 '{conn_type: "snowflake", login: "RIVET_LOADER",
  extra: {account: "xy12345", role: "LOADER", warehouse: "LOAD_WH", database: "RAW", private_key_content: $key}}' |
  gcloud secrets create airflow-connections-sf_rivet --data-file=-
# ClickHouse and a source database: the password is read from the terminal, not typed into argv
read -rs PW
jq -n --rawfile pw /dev/stdin '{conn_type: "clickhouse", host: "ch.internal", port: 8443, login: "loader",
  password: $pw, extra: {secure: true}}' < <(printf %s "$PW") | gcloud secrets create airflow-connections-ch_rivet --data-file=-
jq -n --rawfile pw /dev/stdin '{conn_type: "postgres", host: "db.internal", port: 5432, login: "rivet_reader",
  password: $pw, schema: "app", extra: {sslmode: "verify-full"}}' < <(printf %s "$PW") |
  gcloud secrets create airflow-connections-pg_app --data-file=-
```

(`printf %s` is a shell builtin: the password is in no process's argv, and it gets no trailing newline.) The worker's identity reads these secrets only, through an IAM
condition on the secret name (it needs the project NUMBER):

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding my-project --member "serviceAccount:$GSA" \
  --role roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor \
  --condition='title=airflow-connections,expression=resource.name.startsWith("projects/123456789012/secrets/airflow-connections-")'
```

The DAG names the same conn_ids whatever backend serves them:
`connections=["gcp_rivet", "sf_rivet"]`, `env_from_connections={"PG_URL": "pg_app"}`.

**What the operator does with a secret.** Inside `execute`, each try makes a private folder
(`tempfile.mkdtemp`, mode `0700`, in the worker's temp directory); a key a Connection carries
(`keyfile_dict`, `private_key_content`) and the Snowflake `config.toml` are written into it with
mode `0600`, and the folder is removed in a `finally` when the try ends, whatever its outcome. A
worker killed with SIGKILL runs no `finally`, and the folder stays in its temp directory. A
password (ClickHouse, a database URL) is passed in the environment of the rivet process only, not
of the worker: the same user and root can read it in `/proc/<pid>/environ` while rivet runs.
