# Changelog

All notable changes to `airflow-provider-rivet`. The package is versioned independently of the
rivet binary; its release tags will use the prefix `airflow-v`.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Documentation: the task releases an export lock by an explicit unlock when it ends, so a process rivet left behind
  that holds a copy of the descriptor no longer keeps the lock (measured with a grandchild that kept it; before the
  documentation said the lock lasted until that process exits). A killed task process still leaves the lock to rivet.
  `lock_wait` is per lock: a `run` of the whole config takes one lock per export in turn and can wait up to the
  number of its exports times `lock_wait`.
- **Behaviour change.** Two tasks of two config directories that share one state directory and one relative
  `query_file` could both pass the owner check: it was a read, a check and a write of
  `.rivet_airflow_query_files.json` with nothing between them, so one task ran the other config's SQL and both ended
  green. The copy of the query files and the record are now made under one lock
  (`airflow/locks/state/query-files.lock`, waited for up to `lock_wait`, then `RIVET_AIRFLOW_EXPORT_BUSY`, retryable);
  a config with no `query_file` never takes it.
- **Behaviour change.** Under git-sync (`dags/repo -> rev-<sha>`) the first revision flip made every task of a config
  with a `query_file` refuse for good, naming "two config directories" and the remedy "separate state directories",
  which throws away the stored progress. The owner is now the config directory as the DAG gave it (`dags/repo`, the
  name the copy of the config already uses), so a new revision of the same path is the same owner. The refusal for a
  real stranger is unchanged and now also names the record to delete when the owner is an earlier revision of this
  config or is gone. **Upgrade:** a record written by an earlier version holds the resolved directory
  (`.../rev-<sha>`); it is still read as this config's while the link points at that directory, and the first task
  after the upgrade rewrites it to the DAG's path. A state directory whose link was flipped before any task ran on the
  new version is refused once, naming the file: delete `.rivet_airflow_query_files.json` in the state directory and the
  next task claims the path (tables and progress are not touched). Measured: a record written by the previous release
  with the link on `rev-a`, then the link on `rev-b` and the new version, is refused; after deleting the file the run
  succeeds and runs `rev-b`'s SQL.
- **Behaviour change.** A task ending no longer removes the plan folder of a run that is in progress. Every task's
  cleanup removed any empty `plans/<run_id>/` folder, including the one another task of the same DAG run had just
  created for its `rivet plan --output`, so that apply failed with "output unwritable" and was retried or lost, by
  timing. A run folder is now removed only when nothing in it, and the folder itself, changed in the 24 h before the
  cleanup (the apply touches its folder on every use). **Upgrade:** nothing is stored and nothing to migrate; an empty
  folder an earlier version left stays for up to 24 h longer, then the next task's cleanup removes it.
- **Behaviour change.** A worker's `RIVET_STATE_URL=sqlite:<path>` that the task did not pass on was dropped silently:
  rivet ran on an empty `.rivet_state.db` in `state_dir`, so an incremental export read from the start again and a CDC
  stream re-anchored (measured with rivet 0.32.2 as the oracle: the worker's file held the cursor, the run did not see
  it). It is now refused before rivet starts, as a PostgreSQL state already was (`RIVET_AIRFLOW_STATE_ENV_NOT_PASSED`);
  the remedy is `env_passthrough=["RIVET_STATE_URL"]` (rivet then opens that file), or `env` / `env_from_connections`,
  or unset the variable on the worker. A `sqlite:` state the task passes on is checked where rivet opens it: the
  "state left beside the config" check looks for the named file (`RIVET_AIRFLOW_STATE_BESIDE_CONFIG` names it) instead
  of `state_dir/.rivet_state.db`, and the single-host warning and refusal name it. `RIVET_STATE_URL` is classified by
  rivet's scheme rule (`postgres://`, `postgresql://`, `sqlite:`): a worker value such as `postgres-state.db`, which
  rivet would refuse as an unsupported scheme and which was refused here as PostgreSQL, is no longer refused here.

- **Behaviour change.** Messages that named the wrong thing now name the right one. (1) The Slack title takes its
  `final` / `retryable` word and code from the error that decided the task, not from the first failed unit: a
  final refusal was titled `crashed (retryable)` when an earlier unit had crashed. (2) `run`, `cdc_run` and `apply`
  read rivet 0.32.2's `skip_reason`: a skipped export says why in its line, its headline and the XCom
  `skip_reason`, and a `compact` of several skipped tables gives the reasons (it said `compact skipped: None`).
  (3) A whole-config run takes one lock per export: a `BUSY` headline names the lock that timed out and a success
  headline sums every wait. (4) The stop text of a `cdc_run` task says `rivet run` (there is no `rivet cdc_run`).
  (5) A crash with no Airflow try left (`retries=0`) is an `AirflowFailException` with `crashed_retry` false and
  does not claim a retry. (6) A successful `load` / `compact` whose `per_table` is empty is recorded as
  `result_malformed` in `degraded`. No state or table written before the upgrade is read differently; a DAG that
  filters Slack titles by the old word, or reads `crashed_retry` on a `retries=0` crash, sees the new value.

- **Behaviour change.** A SQL Server or Oracle `connection_url` percent-encoded the database, but rivet reads that URL
  path as written, so `my db` reached rivet as `my%20db` and the load failed with a login error naming another
  database. The database is now written as is for those two schemes, and PostgreSQL, MySQL and MongoDB stay encoded. A
  name holding `@`, `?` or `#` (and `/` on Oracle) is refused with `RIVET_AIRFLOW_CONNECTION_UNSUPPORTED`: rename the
  database. A SQL Server connection whose host is an IPv6 literal with no port gets `:1433` (rivet read `[::1]` as port
  `1]`). Measured live against SQL Server and by rivet's URL parsers.
- odbc.ini is read as unixODBC reads it (`isql -v` measured): a data source name matches in any case, the first section
  of a name and the first value of a key win, an indented `[name` is a header once a section is open, `;` and `#`
  start comments, and a file whose first line of substance is no header is refused naming the file. A stray latin-1
  byte in another data source no longer refuses the file; a byte in the chosen one is refused naming the data source.
  A port above 65535 or written in non-ASCII digits is refused; an IPv6 `Server` / `ServerName` is read.
- A missing or unreadable odbc.ini was reported as "no data source": the refusal now says the file does not exist on
  this worker or cannot be read, and names the remedy (put a readable odbc.ini there, or correct the id).
- The password of a data source read from odbc.ini is masked in the task log.
- The key files of a GCP or Snowflake Connection were named after the Connection id (`gcp-<id>.json`), so an id with
  `/` or `..`, or one of 250 characters, wrote outside the private folder or failed. The files are `gcp.json` and
  `snowflake.p8` (one Connection per kind, so no name is shared).
- The copy of a config with a long file name (about 250 bytes or more) failed with `File name too long`; the stem is
  now cut by bytes, and the hash keeps two long names apart. Names under the limit are unchanged.

### Changed (behaviour change)

- A failed task says why. rivet's error text (the `error` of the `--json-errors` line, and for a failed unit the
  `error_message` of its `--summary-output` entry or the `message` of its error object) is on the failure headline and
  on a failed unit's line of the task log, at the end of the `AirflowException` / `AirflowFailException` text
  (`[code] class: action (export): text`), and in `format_failure`'s `rivet said:` line. It is read as hostile text:
  Airflow's secrets masker reads it first, then it is cut at `\n` only, joined on one line, its control characters
  shown as `\u{1b}`-style escapes, and bounded to 300 characters. The Slack title still holds none of it, and
  XCom still never carries it. rivet's text can hold a **source value** (a cell that failed to convert), which the task
  log and the exception now show; the masker knows credentials, not data. rivet 0.32.2's own `--json-errors` shape
  (`error`, `exit_class`, `code`) is the normal path: the `error_object` degradation and its note ("rivet's failure line
  has no class or action") are gone from the XCom `degraded` list, the task log and `docs/capabilities.md`; a line with
  the contract's own keys (`class`, `retryable`) or a malformed one is read as before. **Upgrade:** nothing is stored
  and nothing to migrate; a log reader that matched the old exception text exactly (`[code] class (export)`) now sees
  `: text` after it, and one that read the `error_object` key finds it absent.

- `build_source_dags` reads each export's layout as rivet resolves it, once, for both modes. A **batch** DAG over a
  BigQuery config with `layout: base_buffer` (what `rivet init --mode incremental` writes) now has `compact.<export>`
  after `load.<export>`; before, it had none, so `<table>` stayed the first pass's snapshot while `<table>__changes`
  grew with every run. A **CDC** stream with `cdc.backfill` and no `layout:` on BigQuery, and a table whose own
  `load.tables.<t>.layout` differs from the section's, now compact (or not) as rivet resolves them. An export without
  `mode:` is `full` (rivet's default) in every reader: its task-log target is `<table>`, not `<table>__changes`, and
  a numeric export name (`name: 2024`) is the text `2024` in task ids instead of a `TypeError` that took the DAG file
  down. **Upgrade:** the DAGs change shape at the next parse (new `compact.*` tasks, paused DAGs stay paused); the
  first `compact` of an export finds the buffer the earlier runs left to merge. To keep a change log
  (no compaction), write `layout: log_view` in `load:`.

- `build_source_dags`: a source whose config cannot be built no longer ends the DAG file. Before, one malformed or
  surprising `<name>.yaml` raised at parse and Airflow registered none of the file's DAGs, so every other database's DAG
  vanished; now that source's DAG keeps its id and has one task, `config`, that fails without retry naming the cause and
  the remedy, and the others are built. A YAML error names its line and column (`ParserError at line 5, column 4:
  ...`). **Behaviour change:** a **batch** DAG over a config that has a `mode: cdc` export (the config `rivet init --mode
  cdc` wrote) is now refused with `RIVET_AIRFLOW_CONFIG_HAS_CDC_EXPORT` instead of silently running the stream's
  baseline recipes beside the CDC DAG on one config and one state database; an all-CDC config in a batch call names that
  cause instead of "`exports` is empty". **Remedy:** give the batch call its own source name, or its own `config_dir` and
  `state_root` (the documented rule, now enforced); a DAG already built over such a config shows the red `config` task
  at the next parse. In a batch plan, an export named `after_<heavy export>` or `wave_<n>_done` no longer duplicates
  an ordering point's task id (the DAG file did not import): the ordering point is `<id>_barrier`.
- `operator_kwargs` may no longer set `max_active_tis_per_dag` (every builder, `build_source_dags` included): it is 1 on
  every rivet task so a task never runs beside another try of itself, and a value there silently replaced it, like a
  `trigger_rule` (already refused). **Behaviour change:** a DAG file that passed it now fails to import with
  `operator_kwargs may not set `max_active_tis_per_dag`...`. **Remedy:** delete the key (a limit across
  tasks is a `pool` in `operator_kwargs`).
- `RivetInitOperator` (`init_args` of `build_source_dags`): the flags the operator owns are refused in every spelling
  clap reads (`--output=x`, `-oX`, `--source-env=X`, `--mode=full` in a CDC DAG, `--mode=cdc` in a batch DAG), where
  only the exact tokens were; and a value that happens to read `cdc` (`--bigquery-dataset cdc`, a source or bucket
  named `cdc`) is no longer refused as a request for `--mode cdc` in a batch DAG, in a CDC DAG too. A DAG already
  built keeps working; one that passed `--output=x` now fails to import (before, rivet failed at the `init` task on
  the repeated flag): delete it from `init_args`.
- `quickstart/dags/rivet_quickstart.py` refuses, naming the streams, a pipeline whose config has more than one
  `mode: cdc` stream (it built the first and never captured the others, with green runs), and reads names and tables as
  rivet does (`name: 2024`, a missing `mode`). `examples/rivet_cdc_per_source.py` builds a stream written as `table:`
  (it raised `KeyError: 'tables'` at parse). **Remedy for several streams:** build the pipeline with `build_source_dags`.

### Changed (operator input)

- A load, compact or apply task given `-p` / `--param` in `extra_args` is refused before rivet starts
  (`RIVET_AIRFLOW_PARAM_NOT_ACCEPTED`, not retried): rivet 0.32.2 takes `-p` on `run`, `plan` and `check` only and ends the
  others `unexpected argument '-p' found` after the lock and the copy of the config. Put the value in `env=`.

- The operators no longer probe the rivet binary for flags it may lack: rivet 0.32.2, the minimum, has `--export`,
  `--table`, `--summary-output`, `--lock-wait` and `--no-notify` on every step the package runs. Removed with them: the
  copy of the config cut down to one export for `load` / `compact` (`RIVET_AIRFLOW_CONFIG_NARROW_UNSAFE`), the
  `<sub> --help` reads, and the `degraded` keys `no_notify`, `lock_wait`, `load_filter`, `load_table_filter`,
  `load_result` and `load_digest`. A `per_table` entry without `target` or without a digest key is `result_malformed`
  (it was named from the config, or `load_digest`); a result with no entry for the table is still named from the
  config. What the package does on 0.32.2 is unchanged.

## 0.3.0 (2026-10-24)

Against rivet 0.32.2 (the minimum) and the contract of ADR-0039 at rivet 0.32.2.

### Added

- `build_source_dags`: one DAG per named database, paused at creation. Until `<config_dir>/<name>.yaml` exists its one
  task, `init` (`RivetInitOperator`), creates the source's state database, runs `rivet init` and `rivet check`, refuses
  a config that writes where another source's does, and writes the file; the next parse builds the CDC or batch DAG
  from it, a stream per CDC export (one over all tables on MySQL and PostgreSQL's `public`, one per table on SQL Server,
  Oracle, MongoDB and other PostgreSQL schemas, each in its own group). A name is an Airflow Connection id, else a data
  source of odbc.ini.
- `env_from_connections` takes `{"conn_id", "database", "odbc_ini", "dsn"}`: another database on the Connection's
  server, and the odbc.ini data source `dsn` (default the id) when no Connection has the id: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL
  Server (`Server = [tcp:]host[,port]`, a SQL login; Windows / Entra sign-in and named instances refused) and Oracle
  (`ServerName = [//]host[:port]/service`; a tnsnames.ora alias refused) drivers. A MongoDB ODBC data source is
  refused: its driver speaks the BI Connector's MySQL protocol.

- `quickstart/`: Docker Compose stacks for Airflow 2.10.5 and 3.3.2 with rivet and this provider, demo MySQL and
  PostgreSQL sources ready for CDC, MinIO and ClickHouse, and four pipelines (CDC and batch per source) built from
  `rivet init` configs; guide in `docs/quickstart.md`.
- A docs site (mdBook on GitHub Pages, https://panchenkoai.github.io/airflow-provider-rivet/) with a command builder
  that writes every command to add your own database as a pipeline of the quickstart stack (`docs/your-database.md`).

### Changed

- `RivetInitOperator` (new in this release) takes only its own parameters: `config`, `state_dir`, `rivet_bin`, the
  environment parameters and `mode` / `source_env` / `init_args`; `build_source_dags` gives the run tasks the rest of
  `operator_kwargs` (#90).
- Internal, no change of behaviour (#88): rivet's result is read by `reading.Reading`, apart from the process; the
  state-directory layout, the payload of a task rivet never started, the Connection lookup and each command's lock are
  each defined once.

### Fixed

- `RivetLoadOperator` and `RivetCompactOperator` passed `table` to `rivet load --table` as written, so a schema-qualified
  name copied from a config `rivet init` wrote (`table: dbo.orders` on SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL outside
  `public`) was refused by rivet 0.32.2 (`RIVET_CLI_TABLE_UNKNOWN`) on every `build_cdc_dag` load. The table is now
  passed by its warehouse name, the dot folded to `_` (`dbo_orders`), and its table lock is taken under that name.
  Found by the pre-release stand (SQL Server CDC on BigQuery, Airflow 3.3.2 and 2.10.5).
- A `run` of the whole config (no `export`) took a lock of its own (`locks/run/<config>`) and a run of one of its exports
  `locks/run/<export>`, so the two started side by side and rivet's lease refused one as busy. The whole config now takes
  every export's run lock, in one sorted order, and rivet inherits them all. Measured with a test that held the whole
  config's lock and started an export run with `lock_wait=0`: it ran, now it is `RIVET_AIRFLOW_EXPORT_BUSY`.

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-22)

Against rivet 0.32.2 (the minimum) and the contract of ADR-0039 at rivet 0.32.2.

### Added

- `rivet_notifications=True` keeps rivet's own `notifications:` on: the operator then does not pass `--no-notify` and
  does not warn about the block. The default is unchanged (rivet's notifications off where the binary can turn them off).
- `single_host=True` declares a deployment with one worker, where SQLite state is allowed under an executor that could
  spread tasks over several hosts (see Changed).
- The per_table digest of `rivet load` / `rivet compact` (rivet >= 0.32.2, ADR-0039 D3) in the task log: the headline
  sums rows, tables, warehouse jobs and bytes billed; one line per table gives a compact's rows inserted / updated /
  deleted and the base's rows after, a load's Parquet parts and source runs, the job ids and the bytes billed. A value
  rivet did not return is left out, never shown as 0. The `rivet.unit` record carries it as `digest` (#63).
- XCom units carry `target` and `buffer`, the warehouse objects a load or compact unit wrote and read, as rivet names
  them (the contract's `xcom_unit*.json`); null for a run or apply unit and on a binary whose result has no names.
- A load / compact task's headline names the warehouse table (`project.dataset.table`): rivet's own name when its
  result has one, else the config's `load:` block, marked `(from config)` (degradation `load_digest`).
- A task that waited for the export's lock logs when it takes it (`took the lock of ... after N s`), and its headline
  gives the time after the wait apart from the wait (#63).
- rivet 0.32.2's codes: `RIVET_STATE_LOCK_TIMEOUT` (rivet's `--lock-wait` ran out) is retried and reads `BUSY`, like
  the package's own `RIVET_AIRFLOW_EXPORT_BUSY` and rivet's other lease stops; `RIVET_LOAD_BLOCK_MISSING`,
  `RIVET_SOURCE_CDC_CHECKPOINT_SHARED` and `RIVET_INIT_CDC_NAME_TAKEN` are final (docs/retries.md).

### Changed

- **Minimum rivet 0.32.2** (`rivet-cli>=0.32.2`); an older binary is refused before it starts
  (`RIVET_AIRFLOW_BINARY_TOO_OLD`).
- SQLite state is refused under an executor that may run tasks on several hosts (Celery, Kubernetes, Edge): a task on
  another worker started from an empty state and re-read every table (`RIVET_AIRFLOW_STATE_SQLITE_MULTI_HOST`).
  `single_host=True` declares one host.
- The degradation `state_url_sqlite` is gone: the config's copy in `state_dir` is how every relative path of the
  config (its SQLite state, a checkpoint, a query file, a local destination) lands there, on every rivet, and is not a
  fallback. Nothing moves.
- The task log is shorter: a one-step task whose step took the task's time has no step line, and "this binary lacks"
  is written at DEBUG, not on every task (#62).
- XCom `rivet_version` holds the whole version line (`0.32.1 (3f337e9e3)`), not only the number.
- README Quickstart: `rivet init` with `RIVET_STATE_URL=sqlite:` (rivet 0.32.2) into the state directory, the
  Connection, a scheduled DAG, where the Parquet lands. The docs now say that a relative local `destination.path`
  lands under `state_dir` (rivet 0.32 anchors it to the config's directory), not under `cwd`, and how rivet 0.32.2's
  `init` checkpoint (`./cdc/<stem>_<export>.ckpt`) and its `.owner` record sit there.

### Fixed

- Under git-sync (the DAG folder a symlink `repo -> rev-<sha>` swapped on every sync), the config's copy in state_dir
  and the lock of a task without an export are named by the path the DAG gave, not the symlink-resolved one. A sync
  left the previous copy behind, still naming the CDC checkpoint, and rivet 0.32.2 refuses a checkpoint another config
  still names (`RIVET_SOURCE_CDC_CHECKPOINT_SHARED`): every CDC stream would have stopped at the first sync.
  Under git-sync, upgrade the provider together with or before rivet 0.32.2: provider 0.1.0 with rivet 0.32.2 is
  refused at the first sync with `[RIVET_SOURCE_CDC_CHECKPOINT_SHARED] cdc: checkpoint '<state_dir>/cdc/<stem>_<export>.ckpt'
  belongs to export '<export>' of config '<state_dir>/<stem>.<8 hex>.yaml', which still reads it; ...`. To clear it,
  install 0.2.0, delete the provider's old copy the message names (`<state_dir>/<stem>.<8 hex>.yaml`; never the
  checkpoint or its `.owner`) and clear the task: the stream continues from its checkpoint.
- On PostgreSQL state, a task whose upstream rivet task ran on another host (another state_dir marker) is no longer
  refused `RIVET_AIRFLOW_STATE_DIR_DIFFERS`: with two Celery workers, each with its own state_dir, a load landing on
  the other host than its extract failed without a retry, in the deployment docs/state.md recommends for several
  workers (measured by the live gate's multi-host leg). SQLite state is still refused.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-18)

First release, against rivet 0.32.0 and the contract of ADR-0039; Python 3.12+, Airflow 2.10 and 3.x.

- Depends on `rivet-cli>=0.32.0`, which installs the rivet binary; without `rivet` on the worker's
  `PATH` the operators run the binary it installed into Airflow's environment.

- Operators: `RivetApplyOperator`, `RivetRunOperator`, `RivetCdcRunOperator`, `RivetLoadOperator`,
  `RivetCompactOperator`, `RivetPlanOperator`; one invocation module builds argv and env, runs
  the process, reads its outputs and classifies the result.
- DAG builders: `build_batch_dag` (plan, then apply / load / compact groups with per-table
  edges and ordered waves) and `build_cdc_dag` (one run task, load and compact per table).
- Retries by the contract: a printed retryable failure is retried, exits 1 and 3-6 are not, an
  exit 2 with no error object is not, a kill is retried under its own budget.
- Preflight: binary present and at least 0.32.0, state location by deployment (a pod needs
  PostgreSQL state and refuses CDC), state directory checks, a warning for `notifications:`.
- Secrecy: XCom and the task log never carry the error message; raw stderr goes to a file.
- `slack_failure_callback` for the Slack provider: a one-line title per failed task,
  `dag.task — <rivet code> (final|retryable)` (else the exception's class), with the run id and
  the task-log link; with a bot token and `channel=` the error text (rivet's error line for the
  failed step, else the exception's message; through Airflow's secrets masker, capped) is a code
  block in its thread; with an incoming webhook, title and error text are one message. The task
  log says what was sent and what Slack answered. Setup guide `docs/slack.md`, test DAGs
  `examples/rivet_slack_alerts.py`.
- `connections=[conn_id, ...]` on every operator: storage and warehouse credentials from Airflow
  Connections of kind gcp, aws, azure, snowflake and clickhouse (the connection type, or the
  extra `rivet_kind`); key files are written `0600` into a private folder removed when the task
  ends, and an unknown kind or two Connections of one kind are refused before rivet starts.
  ("Storage and warehouse connections")
- Every fallback taken against a binary that lacks a contract feature is recorded as
  `degraded` in the task's result and listed in the README.

Changed before the first release, after review (see the README sections named):

- The task log is readable: one headline per task with the outcome first (`OK`, `SKIPPED`,
  `REFUSED`, `FAILED`, `CRASHED`, `STOPPED`, `BUSY`), counts, duration and run id; one line per
  rivet step; `note` lines for degradations and single-host SQLite. A successful task's lines
  were raw JSON and red in the Airflow UI (argv held `--json-errors`); argv and the JSON records
  are now at DEBUG. ("Reading the task log")
- A retry after the task process died past a successful `rivet apply` no longer applies the plan
  again: a `mode: full` export was extracted twice and an incremental one was refused
  `RIVET_PLAN_ARTIFACT_STALE` (a failed task, its load skipped). rivet 0.32.0, the minimum, answers
  the replay itself (a full plan: `already_applied` with the run that applied it; an incremental
  one reads from the cursor its own apply moved), so the package's own record of the apply beside
  the sealed plan and its search of `rivet metrics` are gone, as is the `apply_summary` fallback:
  every apply reads its unit from `apply --summary-output`. ("Retries")
- A failure Airflow will not try again (no try left) is logged at ERROR, also when rivet called it retryable, a
  crash under the crash budget or a busy lock; WARNING stays for a failure Airflow retries.
- rivet 0.32's own answer to a replay of an applied point-in-time plan (`per_export[].status:
  already_applied`, the answering run's `run_id` and counts) is a success with that run's unit,
  logged `SKIPPED: an earlier try already applied this plan`; the word read as `failed` before. The contract test now
  requires every status word of rivet's `run_entry_*.json` fixtures to be known.
- Two tries of one export no longer run rivet at once: every task but `plan` holds a per-export
  (per-table for a load with `--table`) lock file whose descriptor rivet inherits, so a rivet that
  outlives its task keeps it; a task that finds it held for `lock_wait` seconds starts no rivet and
  is retried (`RIVET_AIRFLOW_EXPORT_BUSY`). The degraded per-table load lock was freed when the task
  process died while its rivet ran on. On Linux rivet gets SIGTERM when its task process dies.
  ("Overlap")
- rivet's busy refusals `RIVET_STATE_RUN_IN_PROGRESS` and `RIVET_LOAD_TABLE_BUSY` (exit 5, "wait,
  then repeat") are retried instead of failing the task. ("Retries")
- **A DAG run with a failed task is a failed run.** Both builders end in a `watcher` task
  (`one_failed`). A failed `plan` blocks every extract; a failed CDC `run` blocks every load and
  compaction (`load.T` was `all_done`); extract tasks are `all_success` and ordering goes through
  no-op tasks (`apply.wave_<n>_done`, new `apply.after_<export>`). ("DAG builders")
- A multi-wave batch DAG no longer fails on Airflow 2.10 when an upstream published no XCom.
- A relative `query_file` stays relative and the file is copied beside the config's copy; it was
  rewritten to an absolute path, which rivet refuses. The copy is named
  `<name>.<hash of the source path>.yaml`. State or a CDC checkpoint left beside the original
  config is refused (`RIVET_AIRFLOW_STATE_BESIDE_CONFIG`, `RIVET_AIRFLOW_CHECKPOINT_BESIDE_CONFIG`,
  `RIVET_AIRFLOW_QUERY_FILE`). ("Local worker setup guide")
- The subprocess gets an allow-listed environment instead of the worker's; `env_passthrough`
  and `cloud_credentials` extend it. `env` is no longer a templated field. ("Secrets")
- Raw stderr is never written to the worker's own stderr; without a state directory it goes to
  a private temp directory (`stderr_temp`). Log files are `0600` in `0700` directories, under
  `logs/<dag_id>/<task_id>/`, and only the newest `log_keep` tries of a task are kept. ("Secrets")
- Exit 0 with a failed unit in the summary fails the task (`exit_zero_failed_unit`); a malformed
  error object or result entry falls back to the exit-code table (`result_malformed`) instead of
  raising; the error line is searched in the last 1 MiB of stderr, not the last 200 lines.
- The crashed-budget ledger fails closed (`crashed_ledger`) and is keyed by `max_tries`, so
  lowering `retries` cannot reset it. ("Retries")
- `RivetPlanOperator` swaps the layout file in only when a builder can read it.
- Every path component made from a DAG id, task id, run id or export name is unique to that
  name: a name that is not one lower-case word of safe characters gets a hash of the exact name
  appended. Two exports or two DAGs whose names differed only in replaced characters shared one
  sealed plan, so one export applied the other's plan and was never extracted. `apply` also
  refuses an artifact that records another export (`RIVET_AIRFLOW_PLAN_ARTIFACT_FOREIGN`).
  ("Local worker setup guide")
- A sealed plan belongs to one task, one config and one export: its name carries the task id
  and a digest of the config's path, the config's bytes and the export's query file. Two apply
  tasks of one DAG run with two configs and one export name shared `plans/<run>/<export>.json`,
  so the second applied the first config's plan and was never extracted. `apply` refuses an
  artifact whose `export_name` or `config_path` is missing or not the task's own, expired or
  not. The scratch file of `RivetPlanOperator` is no longer shared by two DAGs that refresh
  one layout file. ("Local worker setup guide")
- A task's log folder is `logs/<dag_id>/<task_id>-<hash>/` for every task id. Retention looks
  only there: files of an older layout are never pruned or deleted (on a file system that
  ignores case, DAG `sales` removed log files of DAG `Sales`). ("Upgrading a state directory")
- A `RIVET_STATE_URL` in the worker's environment that rivet would use (it starts with
  `postgres`) and that the task would not pass to rivet is refused before rivet starts
  (`RIVET_AIRFLOW_STATE_ENV_NOT_PASSED`). A declared value, also an empty one, is not refused.
- The README said a Snowflake or ClickHouse compact task "is skipped"; on rivet 0.31.0 it ends
  `compacted` having merged nothing. It now says so, documents `build_cdc_dag(compact=False)` for
  those warehouses, and names every operator and builder parameter (a test holds the lists to the
  signatures). ("Storage and warehouse connections", "DAG builders", "Operators")
- `build_batch_dag(exports=[])` raises `ValueError`; the watcher carries no failure callback, so
  a callback in `default_args` fires once per failed task.
- The config is read as rivet reads it. `${name}` is resolved from `-p` and the task's env before
  the guards look at `mode`, `name` and `cdc.checkpoint` (a templated CDC mode passed the
  CDC-on-pod guard; a templated checkpoint was looked for under its literal name); an unresolved
  mode counts as `cdc`, an unresolved name or checkpoint is refused
  (`RIVET_AIRFLOW_CONFIG_UNRESOLVED`). Scalars follow serde_yaml_ng: `08` / `09` no longer crash
  the preflight, `017` is not 15, and `name: 2024` is found. The single-export copy for load /
  compact is cut out of the original text instead of re-serialised, so a quoted `'${SECRET}'`
  keeps its quotes; a text that cannot be cut safely is refused
  (`RIVET_AIRFLOW_CONFIG_NARROW_UNSAFE`). (D06, D07, D09)
- `connection_url`: a password without a login, IPv6 hosts, Oracle `service_name`, an encoded
  database name. The version has one source, `airflow_provider_rivet/__init__.py`.
- `slack_failure_callback` on a mapped task reports its own index's code and class; it said "no
  rivet result was published" because the XCom pull returned every index's payload.
- DAG builders: every rivet task is `all_success` whatever `default_args` says, and a
  `trigger_rule` in `operator_kwargs` is refused (with `all_done`, load and compact ran after a
  refused drain); user `default_args` are merged over the builders' `retries=2`; a bare string
  for `exports`, `compact_exports` or `tables` is refused; a name that is no ASCII task id
  (`daily orders`, `orders:v2`, `заказы`) gets a sanitised task id with a hash and keeps its real name;
  in a wave, each heavy export runs alone and the cheap ones after them, like `rivet apply`.
  ("DAG builders")
- On Airflow 3 the exceptions are imported from `airflow.sdk.exceptions`, not the deprecated
  `airflow.exceptions`.
- A clear of a finished `RivetApplyOperator` plans again instead of replaying a sealed plan whose
  cursor the successful apply already moved (rivet refused it `RIVET_PLAN_ARTIFACT_STALE` on
  every clear for 24 h): the artifact is named by the try series (`max_tries`). (D04)
- `RivetPlanOperator` and `build_batch_dag` read a plan of one export, which rivet prints as a
  bare object with no campaign; it was a `KeyError` and an `internal` failure. (D10)
- The sealed plan artifact is mode `0600` whatever rivet's umask, as the README said. (D38)
- Expired plan artifacts and crashed ledgers untouched for 24 h are pruned. (D33)
- An apply whose counts come from `rivet metrics --json` reports the row's status: a
  `skip_empty` export that delivered nothing is `skipped` with its `skip_reason`. (D31)

The environment built from Connections, after the 2026-10 bug hunt (`connections.build_environment`
is now the one place rivet's environment is assembled; README "Storage and warehouse connections"):

- A storage Connection that supplies a credential replaces the worker's variables of its kind
  (`cloud_credentials`, `env_passthrough`): the worker's `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` no longer rides beside
  a Connection's static keys, nor its Azure account key beside a Connection's SAS token. (D12)
- An AWS Connection with `role_arn`, `assume_role_*`, `profile_name` or keys in extras is refused
  (`RIVET_AIRFLOW_CONNECTION_UNSUPPORTED`) instead of running as the worker's identity. (D13)
- Snowflake: with a private key, the Connection's password reaches `snow` as
  `PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE` (D14); a base64 `private_key_content` is decoded to PEM, and content
  that is neither is refused (D15); the extra `region` is written to the `snow` connection (D19);
  `config.toml` is written as TOML, so a non-BMP or control character in any field reads back
  unchanged (D20).
- `connection_url` maps the standard extras with a URL form (PostgreSQL `sslmode`, MongoDB `srv`,
  `authSource`, ...) and refuses `iam`, `redshift`, `unix_socket` (D21); only a real IPv6 literal
  is bracketed, with its zone encoded as `%25` (D23).
- A ClickHouse Connection without a host is refused (`RIVET_AIRFLOW_CONNECTION_INCOMPLETE`)
  instead of becoming `http://None`. (D22)
- On a binary without `apply --summary-output`, an apply's counts come from its own run (rivet's run id with this
  apply's pid), not the export's newest `rivet metrics` row, which may be another process's run.
- A load/compact of a config whose export item ends in an alias (`destination: *s3`) narrows the config
  instead of refusing it `RIVET_AIRFLOW_CONFIG_NARROW_UNSAFE` ("shares its last line with other text").
- A rivet child whose task process died before the parent-death signal took effect stops itself with SIGKILL;
  its SIGTERM ran the inherited Airflow 3 handler, which returns, and the child went on to run rivet as an orphan.
- A database Connection without a host is refused (`RIVET_AIRFLOW_CONNECTION_INCOMPLETE`) like a ClickHouse one;
  it became `postgresql://u:p@/d` and the driver dialled its default socket or host. One check, in `url_host`.
- README: an Azure config reads `account_name: ${AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT}`. (D32)
- A Connection id no backend defines (`env_from_connections`, `connections`) is refused,
  `RIVET_AIRFLOW_CONNECTION_MISSING`, with the refusal in XCom; it was retried with no XCom.
- A config that is not UTF-8, nests too deep, holds a scalar Python cannot convert, or whose
  `exports` is not a list of mappings with a scalar `name` (read as its text: `name: 2024` is the
  export `2024`), is refused `RIVET_AIRFLOW_CONFIG_UNREADABLE`; it crashed with a traceback and
  was retried. The Connection resolution reads the config through the same reader, with `${...}`
  resolved from `-p` and the task's env, so a templated `load.password_env` / `load.connection`
  names the variable rivet reads.
- A rivet binary whose `--version` or `<sub> --help` probe fails or times out, in the preflight
  or while argv is built, is refused `RIVET_AIRFLOW_BINARY_MISSING` with the refusal in XCom; it
  raised a raw `RuntimeError` / `TimeoutExpired` and was retried.
- `on_kill` only sends SIGTERM; the step that started rivet reaps it and kills it after 30 s.
  It used to wait inside Airflow's SIGTERM handler on the lock the interrupted `wait` held, so
  the task hung until the supervisor's SIGKILL and its secrets folder was never removed.
- A stop Airflow requests while no rivet process runs (between `rivet plan` and `rivet apply`, or
  before the first step) keeps every later step from starting: the task fails with a retryable
  error and `stopped_before` in XCom. On Airflow 3, whose SIGTERM handler returns, the next step
  used to start rivet and run it to completion after the stop. (D40)
- rivet's stderr is cut into lines at `\n` only: a `--json-errors` line whose message holds
  U+2028, U+2029 or U+0085 was cut apart, so a retryable failure lost its code and its retry.
  A stderr line that starts with `{` and is not JSON is recorded as `result_malformed`.
- A summary file that is missing (`result_missing`) or not a JSON object (`result_malformed`)
  after an exit-0 process is recorded in `degraded`. ("Works today / needs a newer rivet")
- Live gate (`python -m gate`, not part of the package): the warehouse leg is graded by values a
  second client reads back (google-cloud-bigquery, snowflake-connector-python, ClickHouse HTTP)
  against the source, per warehouse, mode and table; it printed an inventory and graded nothing.
  Only the BigQuery batch compaction may not be skipped; the cloud cleanup lists again and fails
  on a leftover; the Snowflake sweep drops only the gate's own schema shape, quoted; the run tag
  names the compose project and image; the `Live gate` workflow takes the `-glibc2.28` asset or
  the ghcr.io image, which start on Debian 12.
- README "Connections and secrets: recommended setup": keyless GCP (Workload Identity, a Connection
  with only `project`), Google Secret Manager as the secrets backend for keys and passwords, a
  metastore with a Fernet key, and `AIRFLOW_CONN_*` variables last; the IAM grants, and what the
  operator does with a key file.
- Live gate: every stack runs with random passwords and a Fernet key of its own (the source and
  state password `rivet` and the metastore's `airflow` made Airflow mask those words in every task
  log, `/home/***/`), graded by `hygiene/*` cells. `--connections gsm` serves the Connections from
  Google Secret Manager through a reader limited to the gate's secrets, `--gcp-auth adc` runs
  rivet keyless as the containers' identity; each has cells proving where the Connection came
  from, and the cleanup and sweep delete the secrets.
- Documentation: the README is a front page (the flow picture with rivet inside Airflow, badges,
  how the operators work, install, one example) and links the pages under `docs/`: operators,
  DAG builders, retries, state, connections and secrets, Slack alerts, capabilities, overlap and
  limits, development. The setup-guide link the operators print points at `docs/state.md`.
